This avoids having to download through the web and promotes reproducibility as well as error handling. Sratools comes with multiple programs, here we use the fasterq-dump command. Running fasterq-dump -h’ after downloading sratools through pixi gives helpful instructions on how to use the tool as well as the variety of different flags/parameters that can be passed to this program. We use fasterq-dump in a snakemake script to download our rna-seq reads and convert them to fastq format (fasterq-dump handles the download and file format conversion for us).\nI have also created a configuration file where we can store hard-coded values which can then be referenced via our snakefile. This makes the process highly resistant to errors consistent with hard-coding file names. From the email that Dr. Zhang sent me that brings us to a GEO page, I then found the SRR accession ID. Providing this SRR to the fasterq-dump program will then download the appropriate raw sequencing data.\nSratools Fastq-dump\n\n\nCode\nsnakefile=\"download_sra_files.smk\"\ncat $snakefile\n\n\n\n\nCode\nsnakemake -s download_sra_files.smk --cores 8 -p \n\n\nWe can also go to the SRA Web Page for this particular entry and find useful information about the sequencing experiment and runs. Again, we can get this meta data programmatically as well using SRATools\nSequence Read Archive Web Page"

    "text": "Read Alignment and Transcript Quantification\nReads 1 and 2 are technical reads, while read 3 contains our actual transcript (Read 1 is the index for demultiplexing, read2 is the Unique Molecular Identifier or UMI + barcode).\n\nThe next step is to download our reference human transcriptome as well as the cellranger softwrae tool from 10x genomics so we can align our raw reads and quantify them.\nDownload CellRanger\nHere is an in-depth explanation of the CellRanger software What is CellRanger?\n\nRead Alignment: The raw sequencing data, which consists of short reads, is aligned to a reference genome using a suitable alignment algorithm. This step assigns reads to their respective genomic locations.\nBarcode and UMI Processing: Each cell captured by the Chromium platform has a unique barcode and unique molecular identifier (UMI). It uses these barcodes and UMIs to find low-quality cells and identify reads originating from the same cell.\nTranscript Counting: The aligned reads are then used to count the number of times each unique molecular identifier (UMI) appears for each gene. That helps in quantifying the gene expression levels in each cell.\nData Aggregation and Quality Control: The CellRanger pipeline aggregates the counts from all cells into a count matrix, representing each cell’s gene expression profile. Quality control steps are applied to filter out low-quality cells and genes.\nNormalization and Analysis: The CellRanger pipeline normalizes the count matrix to account for cell sequencing depth differences. Then, it applies differential gene expression analysis, dimensionality reduction (such as principal component analysis or t-SNE), and clustering methods to reveal patterns and relationships among cells.\nVisualization: Scientists typically visualize the results using various tools that help them interpret and present their findings effectively. These tools include the BioTuring BBrowserX and the 10x Genomics Loupe Browser.\nCell Type Identification: Researchers can classify and identify different cell types based on their unique gene expression profiles. -Cell state analysis: By comparing gene expression patterns, researchers can identify different cellular states, such as quiescent, activated, or differentiated cells.\nBiomarker discovery: Cell Ranger can help identify genes specifically expressed in specific cell types or conditions, which can serve as potential biomarkers.\nDifferential gene expression analysis: Researchers can identify differentially expressed genes between different conditions or cell types, providing insights into molecular differences.\nCell Trajectory Analysis: By analyzing gene expression changes, researchers can infer cell developmental trajectories and transitions.\n\n\n\nCode\nsnakemake -s download_ref_and_run_cellranger.smk --cores 1 -p\n\n\nCellranger is able to map our reads to the transcriptome and perform transcript quantification. The tool outputs an in-depth summary html file with detailed summary statistics."

High mitochondrial RNA fraction often indicates stressed, dying, or damaged cells that were lysed prematurely before droplet encapsulation in the 10x Genomics workflow. These cells are commonly filtered out because their RNA profiles may be compromised and potentially contaminated with RNA from other lysed cells.\n\n\nCode\nsnakemake -s scanpy.smk --cores 1 -p\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoublet Detection\nI filtered the data to only keep cells that have a minimum of 100 genes expressed as well as removed genes which are found in less than 3 cells. Next, we want to perform doublet detection. Doublets are droplets which have two or more cells.\n\n\nNormalization\nThe next step is to normalize our gene expression values \n\n\nFeature Selection\nFeature selection involves \n\n\nDimensionality Reduction\nDimensionality reduction \n\n\nNearest neighbor graph construction/visualization\nNearest-neighbor graphs are \n\n\nClustering\nLeiden graph-clustering  ****"
