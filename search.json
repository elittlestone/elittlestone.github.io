This avoids having to download through the web and promotes reproducibility as well as error handling. Sratools comes with multiple programs, here we use the fasterq-dump command. Running fasterq-dump -h’ after downloading sratools through pixi gives helpful instructions on how to use the tool as well as the variety of different flags/parameters that can be passed to this program. I used fasterq-dump in a snakemake script to download our rna-seq reads and convert them to fastq format (fasterq-dump handles the download and file format conversion for us).\nI have also created a configuration file where we can store hard-coded values which can then be referenced via our snakefile. This makes the process highly resistant to errors consistent with hard-coding file names. From the email that Dr. Zhang sent me that brings us to a GEO page, I then found the SRR accession ID. Providing this SRR to the fasterq-dump program will then download the appropriate raw sequencing data.\nSratools Fasterq-dump\n\n\nCode\nsnakemake -s download_sra_files.smk --cores 8 -p \n\n\nWe can also go to the SRA Web Page for these samples and find useful information about the sequencing experiment and runs. Again, we can get this meta data programmatically as well using SRATools\nSequence Read Archive Web Page"

    "text": "2.2 Read Alignment and Transcript Quantification\nIn our 10x SC-RNA seq raw sequencing data, Reads 1 and 2 are technical reads, while read 3 contains our actual transcript (Read 1 is the index for demultiplexing, read2 is the Unique Molecular Identifier or UMI + cell barcode).\nThe next step is to download our reference human transcriptome as well as the Cellranger software tool from 10x genomics so we can align our raw reads and quantify them.\nDownload CellRanger\n\nRead Alignment: The raw sequencing data, which consists of short reads, is aligned to a reference genome using a suitable alignment algorithm. This step assigns reads to their respective genomic locations.\nBarcode and UMI Processing: Each cell captured by the Chromium platform has a unique barcode and unique molecular identifier (UMI). It uses these barcodes and UMIs to find low-quality cells and identify reads originating from the same cell.\nTranscript Counting: The aligned reads are then used to count the number of times each unique molecular identifier (UMI) appears for each gene. That helps in quantifying the gene expression levels in each cell.\nData Aggregation and Quality Control: The CellRanger pipeline aggregates the counts from all cells into a count matrix, representing each cell’s gene expression profile. Quality control steps are applied to filter out low-quality cells and genes.\nNormalization and Analysis: The CellRanger pipeline normalizes the count matrix to account for cell sequencing depth differences. Then, it applies differential gene expression analysis, dimensionality reduction (such as principal component analysis or t-SNE), and clustering methods to reveal patterns and relationships among cells.\nVisualization: Scientists typically visualize the results using various tools that help them interpret and present their findings effectively. These tools include the BioTuring BBrowserX and the 10x Genomics Loupe Browser.\n\n\n\nCode\nsnakemake -s download_ref_and_run_cellranger.smk --cores 1 -p"

    "text": "2.3 Cellranger Count Output\nCellranger is able to map our reads to the transcriptome and perform transcript quantification. The tool outputs an in-depth summary html file with detailed summary statistics. I have embedded an interactive html that can be explored for each sample in order to explore the outputted results from Cellranger count. As we can see from these summary statistics, we have &gt; 90% of reads mapping to our transcriptome, indicating high quality reads and a successful library prep. The mean reads per cell is not directly comparable between samples due to the different number of cells in each sample. We can also see the median number of genes expressed per cell in each sample.\n\n📊 Cell Ranger Summary: AL02\n\n\n\n\n📊 Cell Ranger Summary: AL03\n\n\nIn the 10x SC-RNA seq technology, each barcode corresponds to a droplet. Ideally, each droplet will contain one cell. However, it’s possible for two or more cells to end up in a droplet (doublet), or no cells (empty droplet). The knee-plots show how each barcode ranks in terms of total UMIs, which represent unique transcripts captured from each cell. Droplets with a sufficiently low UMI count are likely empty droplets, and Cellranger has a probabilistic model it uses to filter out these droplets and only keep ‘real cells’. Our knee-plots show steep dropoffs, meaning there is a clear distinction between real cells and empty droplets.\nInstead of just counting the total number of transcripts that map to a particular gene and considering that the expression level, UMIs are crucial in order to account for PCR bias. During library prep, transcripts are amplified before sequencing. This amplification can be biased depending on several factors like the GC content of the transcript or transcript length. The UMIs are short oligo-nucleotides that are added to the transcripts prior to amplification, capturing the total UNIQUE transcripts per gene.\nThe main output of Cellranger is a filtered gene-cell expression matrix; rows are genes, columns are cells, and values in the matrix represent the number of UMIs (transcript counts) for each gene in each cell. This count serves as a proxy for gene expression. This filtered .h5 matrix file can then be used for post-processing with software tools like Scanpy in python or Seurat in R. Cellranger count also performs its own post-processing steps including clustering and differential gene expression analysis, however I will perform my own with the python Single Cell Analysis package Scanpy."

    "text": "3 Post-processing with Scanpy\nScanpy Tutorial\n\n3.1 Quality Control\n\n\n3.1.1 Analyze Mito Counts and Select Informative Genes/Cells\nThe first steps of analyzing our Cell Ranger output involve Quality Control (QC), which includes assessing cells with high mitochondrial gene counts. High mitochondrial RNA fraction often indicates stressed, dying, or damaged cells that were lysed prematurely before droplet encapsulation in the 10x Genomics workflow. These cells are commonly filtered out because their RNA profiles may be compromised and potentially contaminated with RNA from other lysed cells.\n\n\nCode\nsnakemake -s scanpy.smk --cores 1 -p\n\n\nViolin plot AL02\n\n\nScatter plot AL02\n\n\nViolin plot AL03\n\n\nScatter plot AL03\n\n\nThe violin plots show the number of genes expressed in each cell, the total number of UMIs in each cell, and the percentage of mitochondrial UMIs/transcripts. For both samples, we see the majority of cells have ~ 1500 genes expressed, somewhere in the several thousand UMI range, and have very small proportions of mitochondrial RNA. The scatter plots just combine these QC metrics into one plot. I filtered the data to only keep cells that have a minimum of 100 genes expressed as well as removed genes which are found in less than 3 cells. \n\n3.1.2 Doublet Detection\nNext, we want to perform doublet detection. Doublets are droplets which have two or more cells and can be detected via Scanpy’s .scrublet method/function. From the scanpy documentation : “Scrublet predicts cell doublets using a nearest-neighbor classifier of observed transcriptomes and simulated doublets”. Doublet identification and removal is a CRITICAL step in post-processing. If we treat a droplet as representing a single cell when it actually represents the transcriptomic profile of multiple cells, this can dramatically skew our clustering/cell-type annotation downstream.\n\n\n\n3.2 Normalization\nThe next step is to normalize our gene expression values across cells. Differences in transcript counts between cells could be the result of a number of different technical reasons, including sequencing depth and capture efficiency, rather than reflecting true differences in gene expression levels between the cells. Additionally, some genes might be extremely highly expressed, while other genes have normal to lower level of expression, which can skew downstream steps like clustering. I use scanpy’s .normalize_total method to make transcript count comparisons between cells accurate and also perform log1p transformation to lessen the impact of very highly or lowly expressed genes.\n\n\n3.3. Feature Selection\nFeature selection involves selecting only the most informative genes for downstream analysis. If our main goal is distinguishing cell-types, the majority of genes are uninformative for this process (ex. housekeeping genes that are expressed at relatively same levels across different cell types) and additionally increase computational complexity required for steps like clustering/annotation. We choose the 2000 most variable genes by using scanpy’s .highly_variable_genes() function. The figures below are visualizations of each gene’s variation across cells.\nVariable genes AL02\n\n\nVariable genes AL03\n\n\n\n\n3.4 Dimensionality Reduction\nDimensionality reduction involves taking our selected highly-variable genes, and performing some computational steps like principal component analysis (PCA) in order to essentially collapse these genes into a smaller subset of explainers or ‘dimensions/axes’ that account for the variation we see in expression levels of particular genes between cells. This reduces the computational complexity even further for the downstream step of clustering. Scanpy’s function .pca computes this for us.\nPCA plot AL02\n\n\nPCA plot AL03\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Nearest neighbor graph construction/visualization\nNow that we have our PCA representation of the cell x gene data matrix, we can compute the neighborhood graph of cells with scanpy’s .neighbors method. After that, we embed this higher-dimensional graph into 2D by using Uniform Manifold Approximate Projection or UMAP; .umap in scanpy. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Clustering\nLeiden graph-clustering \n\n\n\n\nThe leiden graph-clustering \n\n\n3.7 Re-assess QC and Cell-filtering\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8 Manual cell-type annotation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.9 Differential Expression Analysis\n\n\n\n\nThe table below shows the top 10 differentially expressed genes per cluster"
